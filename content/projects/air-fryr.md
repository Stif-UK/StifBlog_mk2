## A mobile application for your air fryer

In 2023 I joined the _air fryer revolution_ and decided to build a small app to help me to get the most from it, which has become my most successful app release in terms of total downloads.

The app is built in Flutter, using a Hive database and GetX for state management. It provides a calculator to calculate air frying times based on standard oven cooking timings, a notebook to keep track of recipes and settings and a temperature reference to help to ensure food is properly cooked.

I maintain a landing page and release notes for [Air Fryr here](https://www.getairfryr.com "Get Air Fryr")
