## A mobile application for watch enthusiasts

WristTrack (formerly WristCheck) is easily my most ambitious app, and is my real passion project.

I initially set out to build an app that would let me track which of my wristwatches were getting the most wrist time, however as time has passed my ambition has grown and I'd like to think I could now build _the best_ mobile app for _watch nerds!_

WristTrack lets users manage information about the watches they own and track when they wear them - this information can be exported or presented in chart form, which can be filtered and manipulated to gain deeper understanding of the collection.

As with my other apps it is built in Flutter, with a fast Hive database at the apps core. Syncfusion charts help bring the data to life and GetX is used to manage state and app navigation. Numerous other libraries help to supercharge the app with additional functionality such as daily notifications and CSV extracts.

I maintain a landing page and release notes for [WristTrack here](https://www.wristtrack.app "WristTrack landing page link")
