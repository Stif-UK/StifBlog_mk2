## A companion app for Metroid Prime

MP Checklist started out as a fun little weekend hackathon. Nintendo had just released a remaster of Metroid Prime for the Nintendo Switch - one of my favourite games of all time - and I decided to quickly throw together an app to help me track my progress through the game (something lacking in the original game, that was partially addressed in later installments of the series...).

Built in Flutter and based around a Hive database, MP Checklist lets you track item collection through the game. Users can quickly search based on the 'room' name shown in the game, and add notes to items they can't access yet to help them understand when to return.

Easily my most niche and least successful app (I wasn't allowed to use 'Metroid' in the app name, and Google wouldn't even allow it in the app description!) I still maintain it as, for those who do use it, it seems to prove useful and it helped me to get 100% completion of the game, so it definitely works!

I don't maintain a landing page for this app, but if you'd like to read more about it you can find other posts [here](/categories/mp-checklist-app "Category: MP Checklist").
