### _Scrum Master // Flutter Developer // GeekDad_
___

Hi, my name is **Grant** and this is where I write about _stuff I like_ and _stuff I do_.

By day I'm a _Scrum Master_ at a large UK bank, working to transform our business and digital delivery to be more _Agile_ (a term some seem to dislike!)

I love the work that I do and the people that I do it with - as with many who work with Agile methodologies I'm passionate about working _smarter,_ with a focus on _value_ to deliver better outcomes, faster for our users and stakeholders.

I used to mention here that by night I was a student, but in 2020 I completed my bachelors degree in _Software Engineering_ with
[the Open University](https://www.open.ac.uk "The Open University").

I love tinkering and playing with code - once upon a time I had hoped to become a mobile app developer, however it turned out my skills were best utilised helping development teams work better and protect them from all the outside noise of a large organisation. So nowadays my evenings are spent messing around with code as a hobby - you can find plenty that I've written on the subject on the site, as well as links to my various published [projects](/projects/).

As well as a place to showcase my projects, I sometimes (but not often enough...) enjoy to just write about things that I like... so feel free to have a wee look around.
