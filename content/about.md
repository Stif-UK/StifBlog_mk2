## _Tester / Agilist / Mountain Biker / Geekdad_
___

Hi, my name is Grant and I created this place so that I had somewhere to dump my thoughs on the internet.

I currently work as an Agile feature team lead for a UK bank, leading a team delivering _modern digital banking solutions_ (or _something_) but as anyone who's ever described themselves as a _"Testing Professional"_ will know, I'll always be a _Tester_ at heart.

I love the work that I do and the people that I do it with - as with many who work with Agile methodologies I'm passionate about working _smarter_ to deliver better outcomes faster for our users and stakeholders.

I've also been studying Software Engineering/Computer Science with
[the Open University](https://www.open.ac.uk "The Open University") for a _looooong_ time now, and love tinkering and playing with code - it's been a while since I've done much in this space though, so kicking off a fresh blog will hopefully give me a place to talk about as well as something _and somewhere_ to do some playing.

_Testing, Agile, Technology, Development & Mountain Biking:_ The only thing I'm more passionate about is my two young sons, but I'm less inclined to use this space to talk about them. The other subjects though? Yeah, I'd like to try to use this space to put some thoughts on paper (or _into the ether..._), as much for my own benefit as anyone elses. If you like what I write, please let me know!
