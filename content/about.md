### _Scrum Master // Developer // GeekDad_
___

Hi, my name is **Grant** and I created this place so that I had somewhere to dump my thoughts and share my projects on the internet.

By day I'm a _Scrum Master_ at a large UK bank, helping to transform our business and digital delivery to be more _Agile._

I love the work that I do and the people that I do it with - as with many who work with Agile methodologies I'm passionate about working _smarter_ to deliver better outcomes faster for our users and stakeholders.

In 2020 I also completed my bachelors degree in _Software Engineering_ with
[the Open University](https://www.open.ac.uk "The Open University").
I love tinkering and playing with code - once upon a time I had hoped to become a mobile app developer, however it turned out my skills were best utilised helping development teams work better and protect them from all the outside noise of a large organisation. So instead I like to mess around with this stuff in my free time.

This site gives me a chance to showcase some of these projects as well as gives a home to allow me to host some of those necessary bits of paperwork such as privacy policies etc _(app development would be much more fun without all the paperwork!)_
