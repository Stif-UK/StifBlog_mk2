## MTB Lockdown upgrades part 2: _Muc-Off Tubeless Valves Review_
---
My lockdown quest to add more _shiny, orange bits_ to my main mountain bike continues!
This time, I'm adding a little more _bling_, but with arguably a bit more functional value thrown in compared to the [Wolf Tooth Blink Kit](/posts/wolf-tooth-bling-kit/) that I reviewed in my first #LockdownUpgrades post.

Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, _Muc-Off Tubeless Valves:_

![Muc-Off tubeless valves image](/img/2020-07/muc-off-pack.jpg "More shinies!")
<sub> _Valves: Muc-Off; Fingers: Models own_ </sub>

### What do they do?
Put simply, they're a set of valves that slot into your wheel rims and let you add air to your tyres!
In the _good old days_ the valve would have been attached to an inner tube, but in the modern age (or _the Future_ as us oldies call it) you should absolutely be running your wheels tubeless if you ride off road.
These valves allow you to do that (along with some rim tape and compatible rims and tyres!) and they allow you to do it _in style!_


### What do they cost?
Ok, let's get the price question out of the way. The RRP for these bad-boys is £24.99 (that's about $30 or €28 at current exchange rates), however I purchased these direct from Muc-Off on sale for _(I think)_ £17.50, which was a far more palatable price.

Is that good value? Well, a _standard_ set of _Stan's_ Tubeless Valves costs about £10 to £12 - I'm specifically referencing these ones as _Stan's_ stuff is almost universally recommended as the _'buy this if you want to set your bike up tubeless'_ standard.

Of course a lot of new bikes and/or new wheels come with tubeless valves in the box _for free_, so chances are you either already have some or have a friend with spares (I have _at least_ 6 unused valves lying around now...)

Do these provide enough value to double the cost of the Stans and make you throw away the _perfectly good_ free ones you might already have? Actually, **I think they do**, (but your milage may vary!) so let me explain why...

### What's so great about them?
To begin with, unlike most tubeless valve's this set comes with different fittings to make sure they help to create a tight seal on _any_ rim, preventing air from escaping until you want it to _(that's their whole purpose!)._ In addition, they also have a couple of really useful extra features:
Firstly, they have a small Allen-key hole on the bottom, and their lockring fits a small (11mm?) spanner - whilst the valves only need to _go on_ hand tight, these could prove really useful if you ever need to remove them.
Second, and honestly _most useful_ they come with a spare valve head that doubles as a valve core remover. _Why is this cool?_, well part of setting a bike up tubeless is seating the tyres on the rim - to do this you want to get a _lot of air_ into them in a _very short space of time_, until you hear a lovely _'pop!'_ as the tyre seats.
To do this, removing the core of the valve so that you can blast air in is super useful.
Previously, I've purchased a valve core removal tool to help with this (from _Stan's_ obviously!) and that cost in the region of £8... see where the value is coming from now?

Finally though, these valves are both super well engineered - the whole valve is machined aluminium (that's _aluminum_ if you live on the wrong side of the Atlantic!) and they feel super premium.

..and of course, let's not forget their true purpose - they just _look great_ and come in a whole rainbow of colours:

<sub> _Taste the rainbow!_ </sub>


### Anything they don't do well?
Honestly, these fulfil such a simple purpose that it's hard to nit-pick here, however there is _one_ area where they fall down (which isn't really their fault) - I run a Nukeproof ARD RIM insert in my back wheel, and as that's a big foam noodle, it comes with special valves which push the foam away from the valve hole a little to allow an air channel to allow enough air flow to seat tyres:

Like this:

<sub> _The top (bottom?) of a Nukeproof ARD valve yesterday_ </sub>

The bottom of the Muc-Off valves is completely flat, which means it doesn't have this air channel.

Now, there are a few options around this - firstly, you could just not run inserts (I expect most people don't!) - I like having one in the back to protect my rim in the event of a _bad_ puncture - I also run a lighter tyre casing at the rear at the moment, so hopefully it'll stop me tearing it! Or you could use one of the other tyre inserts available _(Huck Norris, Rimpact or the super premium Cushcore's wouldn't have this issue)._

The next option would be to buy Nukeproof's competing valve! They also now do a _really cool looking_ anodised aluminium valve:

<sub> _Look familiar? - Image "borrowed" from singletrackworld.com - subscribe to their mag, it's great!_ </sub>

The Nukeproof's are a little cheaper I think, and have a valve core tool on _each_ cap, rather than just on the 'spare' cap - but I went for the Muc-Off's for two reasons. First, I didn't know the Nukeproof ones existed when I got them _(seriously...)_, but second, and _by far_ most importantly: _They don't come in orange!_.
Come on Nukeproof, sort it out!

The final option, and the one I went for, is to just make your own ghetto McGuyver _(hi fellow 80's kids!)_ solution:

![Ghetto fix image](/img/2020-07/ghetto-fix.jpg "Seriously, what's with all the thumb shots!")
<sub> _Believe it or not, this worked just fine!_ </sub>

Yep - I stuffed a manky bit of cardboard and some tape around one of my valves...and it worked _just fine!_

### Anything else to say?

So, by now you'll know that I really like these valves - I reckon they're decent enough value, function _really well_ and they _look super sweet!_.

The only other point I think I should note is that they come in three lengths - 44mm, 60mm or 80mm. Now, I assumed this was _'short', 'normal' and 'long'_...so just went ahead and ordered the 60mm ones without measuring my current valves.

Turns out 60mm is _really long_...honestly, I can't imagine why anyone would want or need 80mm ones on a mountain bike (that's like _a mile_ long, right?).

Despite this though, I'm really happy with how these look on the bike - just a wee subtle bit of colour on the wheels. _Lovely_. The fact they also function super well is a bonus!

![The final result image](/img/2020-07/The-end-result.jpg "Super sexy!")
<sub> _Is that a Muc-Off Tubeless valve on your rims, or are you just pleased to see me?_ </sub>

One last note - whilst writing this I found out that Muc-Off,  in an _excellent_ demonstration of entrepreneurship/money-grabbing _(delete as appropriate)_ also now sell 'accessory kits', consisting of just the lockrings and caps, which would allow you to have these different colours to the main valve - I can't help but wonder how blue ones would look with the orange on my bike...

_(Honestly hope that last bit didn't sound too arsey! I think Muc-Off are an awesome company, I've been buying their stuff for almost 25 years!)_

___
| The Ratings   |   |
|---------------|---|
| Utility | 9/10 - OK, they're doing a simple job, but they work _well_. Bonus points for the built in valve core tool!  |
| Aesthetics    |  9/10 - These look great, but they're a _really small_ part of a bike! |
| Value         | 8/10 -  Glad I got these on sale, I'd have cried paying full price! |
| Overall       | 9/10 - I'd score these a perfect ten if they were just a _wee bit_ cheaper and were easier to fit with the ARD inserts. |

### _Closing Comments_

_These look fantastic (especially against some all-black rims), work really well and have a few wee extras - such as the valve core tool and Allen key/spanner tightening - that really add to their value. A little expensive at full price, but are definitely worth a small premium over basic tubeless valves. **Recommended!**_
