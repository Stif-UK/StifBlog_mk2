## Putting the Cart before the Horse
---

So, this isn't the first website I've ever thrown together. Nor the first blog. Not even the first blog built using a static site generator...

A few years ago (I'd love to say a couple, but I'm scared it's now _far more..._), I registered the domain [granthutchison.com](http://www.granthutchison.com "granthutchison.com"), not only because _vanity domains are cool_, but because I wanted to carve out a little corner of the internet to write and play.

That might have been my first mistake.

I built the site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll Website"), then spent ages getting the site to look and function just as I wanted it. I had _great fun doing this_ and ended up with a nice responsive site that looked pretty good (at least I thought so!).

The problem was, I didn't have _anything to write_. So after uploading the site, I updated it maybe twice, before leaving it sitting for _years_.

Now, maybe I should clarify for those who don't know me - I'm a terrible introvert. That might actually be more of a surprise to those that _do know me_ actually, but the thought of people reading anything I've written fills me with anxiety.

The thing is, I _did_ have a few ideas about the _'play'_ side of things - I wanted to try to make a few small javascript based apps, to play with different frameworks and put together a wee portfolio... I just never got round to doing much more than getting any of these past 50% done...

### _"why the hell are you doing this again then?"_

Yeah, that's the real question isn't it?

I've again gone and built a site without a real plan for what to _actually do with it_ (this time using [Hugo](https://www.gohugo.io "Hugo Website") ).
But I do have some thoughts.

So - I think I _should_ write some stuff - I think it's good for me to turn my mind off a little from work, family, _the ache in every part of my body as I slowly work my way towards my place in eternity_ (wow... got a little dark there...). Despite the awful anxiety, I do enjoy putting my thoughts together on a page.
There are also some things I'd quite like to write about - I've gone back to mountain biking again after over a decade away from it (and I'm loving every minute so far!). I drive an electric car (_like some kind of tree hugging hippy_) and would love to share my experiences of that with _The World_.

I'm also getting close to finally finishing my Open University degree - I really should keep a bit of a learning journal as I progress my final project and doing it online might be of some benefit to others at some point.

_...and I even have some thoughts for more little projects that I'll probably never finish..._
