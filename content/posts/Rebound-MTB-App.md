## The Rebound MTB App
---

### Part 1: The beta release

For the past _forever_ I've been studying with the [Open University](http://www.open.ac.uk/), working towards a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and after all that time _the end is in sight!_.

To complete the degree I have to undertake a significant project, so I've teamed up with the guys at [Rebound](www.lennoxmtb.com) to build a mobile application to support them.

Rebound is a registered charity, which aims to _"develop the local community through sport"_ - with a primary focus on mountain biking. They've grown over the years and now run a series of events in and around Lennoxtown (including cycle maintenance classes,  skills coaching and regular guided rides in the local forest) and are in the process of agreeing lease terms to build, manage and maintain a designated bike park in [Falkland](http://www.lennoxmtb.com/falkland.html), a short drive away in Fife.

<sub> _Extreme to the max!_ </sub>

To support them we have discussed some key features for the app to provide, as well as engaging the wide group of users who are current members of the [Falkland Bike Park Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hillsidehooligans/?multi_permalinks=4164629353607551) and now that some of the basic features are in place it's reached the point where we're keen to release the app in beta form to start getting some feedback whilst I build some of the more complex features.

As part of the Apple release process they ask for a _marketing link_, so it felt like a good time to write a little about the app, what it currently does, and what the future plans are (as I expand on this, I'll update this post with links to additional posts in the future).

### What does the app do?

In the initial beta release the application provides two features: A weather forecast for the club riding locations (both Lennox Forest and Falkland Bike Park), and a support feature to help bikers report their location in the event of an accident.

#### What's the weather like?

The first feature is nice and simple: A weather forecast so that users can tell if they should wear shorts or pack a waterproof to ride _(Note: Please don't use this as an excuse to not get out and ride!)_

<sub> _Should you pack that waterproof?_ </sub>

The forecast provides: Current conditions, a 7 day forecast summary and a detailed 48 hour forecast.

#### My friend's had a crash, what do I do!

Next up, a feature that we hope nobody ever needs, but that they might be glad to have if they ever do!

The app can be used to help identify the users location, using [What3Words](https://what3words.com/), a system that maps the whole planet as 3m x 3m squares, and provides a simple 3 word identifier for each.

Additionally it can be used to dial local emergency services and provides a link to the [British Red Cross first aid app](https://www.redcross.org.uk/). _(this is a great application that I recommend, however it is no substitute for proper first aid training)_

### What's next?

Moving forward we have a few exciting features in the pipeline - the next out of the gate will be an in-app news feed that Rebound can use to share news and updates, as well as an event calendar to allow users to find out what's going on.

### Sounds amazing - how can I get my hands on it?

The beta release is available via invitation - you can find information on the [Falkland Bike Park Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hillsidehooligans/?multi_permalinks=4164629353607551).

Once the application goes fully live it will be available both via Google Play and the App Store via the below links:
