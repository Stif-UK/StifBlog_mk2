## Attempting to grow my user base
---
Now that I've released three apps - two of which I'd like to think have the potential to be really useful to a decent number of people (sorry MP Checklist... I think you might just be a bit _too niche!)_ - I think it's time that I make a bit more of an effort to get help more people to _find_ the apps!

So, as well as releasing updates to both [WristCheck](/posts/wristcheck_v1.5_release_notes/) and Air Fryr recently, I've also undertaken a couple of tasks with the hope of getting the apps in front of more people.

### The landing pages

First, now that my apps have _broken even_ (another long overdue post! Since monetising the apps I've earned enough to cover my annual development fees, but I'm a _long way_ from what I'd call 'profitable'!) I thought I'd spend a little and register some domains for the apps.

Starting with [getAirFryr.com](https://www.getairfryr.com) and then following the same pattern with [wristcheck.app](https://www.wristcheck.app).

If you've clicked on the links above you'll see that not only have I registered the domains, but I've put up landing pages for each app too! I found a super simple Jekyll template created by [Emil Baehr](https://emilbaehr.com/) which let me create simple homepages for the apps really easily - it was as simple as forking his repository on github, changing some config and page content and then publishing via github pages (which also means they're currently free to host!).

Having a simple landing page for each app, where I can provide direct links to each app store, highlight the key app features and publish a quick and simple changelog for each (and link back to this blog where I can continue to write a bit more in-depth, diary style about the apps) is great, as it means I just need to provide a simple web link if I want to share the apps with anyone, rather than trying to direct them to find the app themselves on the appropriate app store.

### Am I an influencer yet?

The next step in my _master plan_ (lol!) was to create a social media presence for the apps - I'm approaching this from a couple of directions.

To start with, I set up an [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/getairfryr/) for Air Fryr - as I built the app to help me get the most from my air fryer, it probably comes as no surprise that I use it to cook a lot, so I thought I could capture and share lots of pictures and short, poorly filmed videos (I've only posted a couple so far, which have had about 150 views each) - for Air Fryr I think I'll also branch out to TikTok as it seems fitting.

For WristCheck I've done something similar, but with more of a focus on just sharing pictures - I often post watch shots to some Facebook groups already, so all I'm really doing here is the same but now I've got a wee dedicated [Instagram corner](https://www.instagram.com/wristcheck.app/) to do it in!

I've also set up a profile for WristCheck on the social media platform formerly known as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WristcheckApp).

My intention is just to share watch and air fryer related pictures, comments, reels etc in the hope of getting the apps a bit more visible (with minimal effort and expense)... will it work? Who knows! But it'll be fun anyway!

I'll post an update at some point in the future if I ever manage to get more than three followers...
