      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s fast approaching a year since I last wrote about how much money my little app side hustle was bringing in, and how I had (at that point) reached a basic &amp;lsquo;break even&amp;rsquo; point, which I defined as &amp;lsquo;my app bills for year paid&amp;rsquo; i.e. bringing in enough to cover the price of my annual Apple developer subscription, covering my one off Google Play developer bill and covering the cost of setting up some domains I purchased as app landing pages.</description>

      <description>Breaking Even&amp;hellip; Link to heading Right, while I&amp;rsquo;m in the blogging mood, here&amp;rsquo;s another post that really is long overdue! Back in March (wow!) I wrote a quick update on how much income I&amp;rsquo;d made via advertising on WristCheck and via ads on the website and promised further updates.&#xA;Since then a few major things have happened - firstly, I released two additional apps (technically I released MP Checklist just before that post&amp;hellip;) and secondly I finally got around to adding an in-app payment option to allow users to pay what they wanted to turn the ads off forever (and again, I definitely need to write a little about how and why I implemented that!</description>

      <description>Users and Earnings Link to heading So, back in September I both implemented ads on the site and released my first proper app (although I didn&amp;rsquo;t put Ads into WristCheck until v1.2 about a month later).&#xA;This was all a fun experiment to see if I could make this wee hobby break even&amp;hellip; want to hear how it&amp;rsquo;s going?&#xA;A summary of costs Link to heading Let&amp;rsquo;s start off with what it costs to put things together.</description>
