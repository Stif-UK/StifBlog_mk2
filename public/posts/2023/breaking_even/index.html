<p>Right, while I&rsquo;m in the blogging mood, here&rsquo;s another post that really is long overdue! Back in March (wow!) I wrote a <a href="/posts/the_millionaire_life/" >quick update</a> on how much income I&rsquo;d made via advertising on WristCheck and via ads on the website and promised further updates.</p>
<p>Since then a few major things have happened - firstly, I released two additional apps (technically I released <a href="/posts/new_app_mp_checklist/" >MP Checklist</a> just before that post&hellip;) and secondly I finally got around to adding an in-app payment option to allow users to pay what they wanted to turn the ads off <em>forever</em> (and again, I definitely need to write a little about how and why I implemented that!).</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s now six months later and I have additional income streams&hellip; <em>am I rich yet?</em></p>
<h3 id="the-goals">
  The Goals
  <a class="heading-link" href="#the-goals">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go through things again and break things down - I&rsquo;ll take data from a spreadsheet I keep and call out my earnings across ads and in app payments, then add it all up at the end!</p>
<p>Firstly though, why am I monetising the apps? I won&rsquo;t do the full breakdown again, but as I mentioned in the first post on this subject developing mobile apps isn&rsquo;t free.
Again I&rsquo;ll ignore the cost of my time <em>(it is a hobby after all!)</em> but in summary I&rsquo;m looking to make a little over <em>£100</em> a year to consider myself broken even - since the last post I&rsquo;ve registered some <a href="/posts/self_promotion/" >new domains</a> so let&rsquo;s set a target of <strong>£150</strong> for the purposes of this post.</p>
<h2 id="ad-revenue">
  Ad Revenue
  <a class="heading-link" href="#ad-revenue">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>So, how much am I earning from ads? Well firstly, <em>nobody reads this website</em>, so from the web ads, virtually nothing! In total I&rsquo;ve earned <strong>£2.79</strong> from the website, and based on this I think I&rsquo;ll roll back the ads - I think they just get in the way. I also have zero intention of adding any to the app landing pages as those aren&rsquo;t there to be monetised, but to help people find the apps.</p>
<p>Speaking of the apps, those are actually a rather different story! My total ad revenue between October 2022 and August 2023 is actually a quite healthy <strong>£91.18</strong>&hellip; yes, you read that right, I actually earned enough from ads to cover my annual Apple Developer fee of £79!</p>
<p>This includes a couple of spikes in both May and then again in August where the <em>Air Fryr</em> app went a bit viral - amazingly people (when they learn about the app) seem keen to try it so a few mentions on Facebook Air Fryer groups (yep, that&rsquo;s where I hang out now!) has been enough to give me some big bumps in revenue.
After the first time the user numbers did slowly roll back down, but I&rsquo;m just coming off one of those peaks and currently have around 1100 users across the apps! Which is honestly <em>amazing!</em></p>
<h3 id="in-app-payments">
  In App payments
  <a class="heading-link" href="#in-app-payments">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>Now lets move on to in app payments - I introduced these earlier in the year but they are paid by the platforms a month or two in arrears. Income isn&rsquo;t massive (I did get an initial jump on WristCheck from existing users who must have welcomed the ability to go ad free) but I do see the odd purchase one or two times a month.</p>
<p>In total though I&rsquo;m tracking an total across the apps of <strong>£55.11</strong> - not massive, but I honestly think it&rsquo;s so awesome that people value what I&rsquo;ve built enough to consider paying for it at all!</p>
<h3 id="totals">
  Totals
  <a class="heading-link" href="#totals">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>So, doing some creating rounding that adds up to rough expenditure of <strong>£150</strong> and rough income of <strong>£150</strong>&hellip;</p>
<p>As the title of this post proclaims, I&rsquo;ve pretty much <em>broken even!</em></p>
<h3 id="what-next">
  What next?
  <a class="heading-link" href="#what-next">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>This is partly why I&rsquo;ve turned a bit of attention to trying to increase awareness of the apps to drive installs a bit - I&rsquo;m putting all revenue into a separate bank account and would love to now aim to save enough to get a second hand iPhone to aid in testing whilst I&rsquo;m building the apps (I&rsquo;ve kept my old Google Pixel 4 to use specifically as a test device and it makes a bit difference on the Android side of things) - nothing fancy, just something old and second hand that&rsquo;ll get at least one or two more OS updates.</p>
<p>Will I manage that? Who knows, but one step at a time eh? Maybe one day I&rsquo;ll earn enough to retire!</p>
