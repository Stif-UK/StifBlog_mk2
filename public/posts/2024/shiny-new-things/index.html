        <p>It&rsquo;s fast <a href="/posts/breaking_even/" >approaching a year</a> since I last wrote about how much money my little app side hustle was bringing in, and how I had (at that point) reached a basic &lsquo;break even&rsquo; point, which I defined as &lsquo;my app bills for  year paid&rsquo; i.e. bringing in enough to cover the price of my annual Apple developer subscription, covering my one off Google Play developer bill and covering the cost of setting up some domains I purchased as app landing pages.</p>
<p>As I think I&rsquo;ve said before, I like the idea of being open and honest about my earnings and expenses - I put a significant amount of effort into building my wee apps, and whilst I don&rsquo;t expect to ever make a <em>true profit</em>, some people have paid for the apps I make, so I think it&rsquo;s only fair that I share a little about where that money goes.</p>

<p>First, let me set the scene for this post - to keep things simple I&rsquo;m not going to talk about what I&rsquo;ve earned <em>since</em> that last post, but rather what I&rsquo;ve earned <em>in total</em> from my apps so far.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll touch a little on the expenses I&rsquo;ve incurred, and then talk about how I&rsquo;ve thrown all the money away on <em>one big purchase</em> (which will make this post title make more sense&hellip;).</p>

<p>So, how have I been gathering data? I could probably pull detailed reports from Apple, Google Play, Admob or Revenuecat, but instead I&rsquo;m going to keep it easy - every month I note down my earnings in a spreadsheet, split into three streams (that are all a little different&hellip;)</p>
<ol>
<li>Ad revenue - I can see on my Admob dashboard what I earn each month - however, this only pays out every time the <em>banked</em> amount (which is locked in at the end of every month) passes £60. Over the holiday period (when ads are more lucrative) this meant a payout every two months, but outside of that it means a 3-4 month gap between payments.</li>
<li>App Sale Revenue - I&rsquo;ve implemented Revenuecat in all of my apps to mediate payments (which is awesome and free until a point where I start earning an amount probably high above what I ever will&hellip;) but the final processing still goes through Google and Apple, so most months I get a small deposit from each. Google pays around a month in arrears, and Apple are a bit behind that - generally I capture this amount <em>when it hits my account</em> unlike the ad value that I tend to forecast out on my spreadsheet, based on what&rsquo;s been locked in each month.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any money that comes in goes straight into a separate bank account (technically a partition of a bank account&hellip;) so I&rsquo;ve got visibility of my total.</p>

  </a>
</h3>
<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s skip to the end - as mentioned everything has gone into a single bank account, and although I have (and have tracked) costs, I&rsquo;ve ignored them from that point of view&hellip; all of my outgoings I&rsquo;ve paid for out of pocket, and left the app income accumulating.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s in the bank account? Right now, without taking anything out from day 1, I have exactly <strong>£764.16</strong> and I know that over the next couple of months that total will (or would) rise to in the region of £900!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to lie, I think that&rsquo;s <em>pretty cool!</em></p>
<p>I clearly couldn&rsquo;t live off this and in the real world (if I don&rsquo;t ignore my expenses) about a quarter of that has probably gone on costs&hellip; but it&rsquo;s still ace that people have liked what I&rsquo;m doing enough to support me (even if the numbers that support are generally low).</p>
<p>This is of course the total over the past almost two years though&hellip; although I have seen some growth as that time has passed. In the UK this income is <em>after</em> the 15% deductions that the app stores take from small developers and <em>at this stage</em> is essentially tax free for me&hellip; which would change to another 40+% deduction on any earnings above £1,000 in a tax year&hellip; although I&rsquo;m not even close to that at this stage!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep this fairly high level, but think it&rsquo;s interesting to talk a little about how things split out as the apps behave a little differently in that sense.</p>
<p>Firstly, Air Fryr - this has <em>by far</em> the highest number of downloads (passing 7000 now!) with a regular churn of new users, but retention is lower and there&rsquo;s a far smaller number of sales as a percentage of downloads - it&rsquo;s the kind of app that people are happy to get for free, and even running a $1 sale only nudges people to purchase it. Interestingly though, it brings in more ad revenue (ad revenue is seasonal, but at the peak I was bringing in ~£30/month via ads, mostly from Air Fryr - although this has massively dipped now that we&rsquo;ve passed the peak holiday season!)</p>
<p>Then we have WristTrack, which is in some ways the opposite - it&rsquo;s got a far smaller user base, but it is both a) a much &lsquo;stickier&rsquo; app (users that it clicks with will keep coming back) and b) a higher proportion of users actually buy it (and I&rsquo;ve tried to start nudging that a bit by starting to add <em>Pro only</em> features&hellip; which I think is fair given the nature of the app and the significantly higher effort it requires to maintain it). Interestingly, a higher proportion of users who purchase the app, also purchase at a higher price - generally the prices of WristTrack are a choice of a small/medium/high payment (£2/£5/£9) - rather amazingly I&rsquo;ve had a few purchases at the higher end and whilst I&rsquo;ve not calculated an average, I suspect it lies somewhere slightly above the middle option, which is awesome!</p>
<p>Despite the differences between the two apps the income breakdown is probably close to 50:50 between them. (You may notice I&rsquo;ve not mentioned MP Checklist, which is because my income from that is still single figures - but I&rsquo;m always happy whenever anyone finds it and gets some use out of it, I didn&rsquo;t build any of these apps to get rich!)</p>

</h3>
<p>As I mentioned above, I&rsquo;ve kinda ignored outgoings as I&rsquo;ve just payed for things out of pocket when they come up, rather than using the actual income for them (although I&rsquo;m definitely keeping notes, as there always is the potential that I&rsquo;ll pass the boundary where I&rsquo;d need to start reporting the income for tax purposes!), but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that there aren&rsquo;t costs involved with making the apps&hellip;
A quick overview would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple Developer subscription - £79/year</li>
<li>Domain name registrations - £60 to cover the next 2 years (bumped up a bit due to the WristCheck / WristTrack rebranding)</li>
<li>I also tried running some ads on Instagram, which totalled £60, but definitely <em>did not</em> return that value!</li>
</ul>
<p>Going forward, I might try a few other things to help more people to find the apps, but that&rsquo;s for another post!
&hellip;and of course, I&rsquo;ve not costed the hours I spend working on the apps (and that is a <em>huge</em> number really&hellip; definitely in the 100&rsquo;s of hours!)</p>
<p>Since I have made almost made £900 though (including the payments I know are coming in the next couple of months) I decided now was the time to put a bit more of my own money towards this wee endeavour and upgrade my aging MacBook Pro to something with the <strong>oomph</strong> to get a bit more done!</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll write a separate post about this, as moving from an underpowered (in terms of RAM and hard drive space at least) Intel based 2019 MacBook Pro to a modern, Apple Silicon based one has been <em>absolutely game changing</em> - it will genuinely speed up my dev process no end&hellip; but it wasn&rsquo;t cheap&hellip;</p>
<p>I do hope this doesn&rsquo;t come across as boastful - I&rsquo;m simply trying to account for the incomings and outgoings of a hobby developer (and this Mac will be used pretty much exclusively for this hobby!) - but the cost of this upgrade (with a student discount - my card doesn&rsquo;t expire until this September!) was around £1900 (although I was able to claim and use some gift vouchers from cashback sites etc to help towards that&hellip;)
So on top of the deductions above, I can add another <em>£1000</em>&hellip; this is not a cheap hobby! :&rsquo;(</p>
<p>But I do still think it has potential to grow, and I <em>love</em> getting feedback and comments on the apps (both the main apps have a pretty favourable rating on the stores) and it genuinely makes my day to hear that people enjoy using them&hellip; and I&rsquo;m not sure you can put a price on that&hellip;</p>
