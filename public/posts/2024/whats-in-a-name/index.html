        <p>In early June I got a rather unexpected email from Apple&rsquo;s legal team&hellip;</p>
<p>My little watch app <em>WristCheck</em> had come to the attention of a much bigger <em>WristCheck</em> - the folks at <a href="https://www.wristcheck.com"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wristcheck.com</a>, who had reached out, via Apple, to let me know that they held a Trademark on the name&hellip;</p>
<p>Now, before I go any further I want to be <em>really clear</em> that I don&rsquo;t grudge the <em>WristCheck</em> team for wanting to protect their Trademark - they absolutely have a right to do that and I should have had the sense to check when I created the app!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to lie, when I first got the email I was worried that I&rsquo;d got myself into <em>trouble</em> - the message from Apple was (understandably) very formal, but it did loop in an engineering lead from <em>WristCheck.com</em> and asked me to reach out directly&hellip; so I did, and I have to say the team at <em>WristCheck</em> were great and were happy for me to go and try to rebrand the app quickly and get a fresh build out, without pushing me to pause app downloads until it was complete.</p>
<h3 id="the-artist-formerly-known-as-wristcheck">

  <a class="heading-link" href="#the-artist-formerly-known-as-wristcheck">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>The hardest part of the task was coming up with a new name - I went around the houses a bit before settling on WristTrack (it was only after I&rsquo;d completed the update that a friend suggested the possibly wonderful &lsquo;WristWatch&rsquo;&hellip;).
The actual update wasn&rsquo;t too bad - whilst I haven&rsquo;t fully separated out all of the text in the app into separate reference files, there is quite a bit stored that way, so I was able to get most pages updated relatively quickly.</p>
<p>Once the app was updated I sent the app for review by Apple and Google and then reached back out to the WristCheck team who great again - and they were kind enough to send out a little goody bag for me to thank me (which was super nice, when arguably I&rsquo;m the one who should have been apologising!)</p>
<p>The pack included this great little book called &lsquo;The Magic of Watches&rsquo;:</p>
<p><img alt="The Magic of Watches book image" src="/img/2024-06/wristcheck_book1.jpg" title="Magical!">
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <em>Magical!</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><img alt="The Magic of Watches internal image" src="/img/2024-06/wristcheck_book2.jpg" title="Gotta love a Speedmaster!">
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <em>Gotta love a Speedmaster!</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>But of course, that wasn&rsquo;t quite the end of things&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="all-the-other-stuff">
  All the other stuff
  <a class="heading-link" href="#all-the-other-stuff">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>Whilst this initial update was enough to get a renamed app into the stores, it doesn&rsquo;t give the full picture. Firstly, the first release didn&rsquo;t get 100% of the &lsquo;WristCheck&rsquo; name references out of the app - the name still appeared in some onboarding screenshots, as well as a link to the original wristcheck.app website&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;and on that subject - the website! Once the app was out I registered the new domain <a href="https://www.wristtrack.app"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wristtrack.app</a> and cancelled the renewal on the old one. Whilst the site is simple, it makes it easy to share a single link which helps people find the app on each platform - it&rsquo;s also now the home of essential things like the privacy policy, and lets me write up quick release notes for the app (both of which I now keep separate from here).</p>
<p>Finally, there was a need to rebrand my little <a href="/posts/self_promotion/" >Instagram account</a> to both point to the new website and show the new app name (as an aside, I&rsquo;ve updated the links on the other page, but it&rsquo;s probably clear that whilst I&rsquo;ve kept the WristTrack instagram account active and updated, the Twitter account is barely touched and I&rsquo;ve not done much with the Air Fryr insta account&hellip; I&rsquo;m just less interested in taking pictures of food!).</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s my little tale of woe&hellip;</p>
<p>Tl;Dr: I picked an app name that I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to use and ended up having to spend a week updating the app and everything associated with it! Also, the team at <a href="https://www.wristcheck.com"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wristcheck.com</a> are genuinely great!</p>
<p>Stif out!</p>
