      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re over halfway through 2024, and as I type this I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated the site at all this year&amp;hellip; which is madness, as I&amp;rsquo;ve got lots to share!&#xA;I may go back and backdate some posts, with some updates on the apps and a long overdue earning update, but first&amp;hellip;&#xA;Rebuilding the site Link to heading I recently got a new Macbook, which has absolutely supercharged my development - seriously, the jump from an underpowered Intel based machine to the latest Apple Silicon is like stepping into the future!</description>

      <description>Breaking Even&amp;hellip; Link to heading Right, while I&amp;rsquo;m in the blogging mood, here&amp;rsquo;s another post that really is long overdue! Back in March (wow!) I wrote a quick update on how much income I&amp;rsquo;d made via advertising on WristCheck and via ads on the website and promised further updates.&#xA;Since then a few major things have happened - firstly, I released two additional apps (technically I released MP Checklist just before that post&amp;hellip;) and secondly I finally got around to adding an in-app payment option to allow users to pay what they wanted to turn the ads off forever (and again, I definitely need to write a little about how and why I implemented that!</description>

      <description>Attempting to grow my user base Link to heading Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve released three apps - two of which I&amp;rsquo;d like to think have the potential to be really useful to a decent number of people (sorry MP Checklist&amp;hellip; I think you might just be a bit too niche!) - I think it&amp;rsquo;s time that I make a bit more of an effort to get help more people to find the apps!</description>

      <description>WristCheck v1.5 Release Notes Link to heading Opps - I seem to have skipped writing up notes when I released WristCheck v1.4! (and for the last couple of Air Fryr releases&amp;hellip;) I&amp;rsquo;ll add a quick summary at the end!&#xA;But onto the details - WristCheck 1.5 is a fairly big update to the user interface of the main watchbox view. I&amp;rsquo;ve made search more prominent, given a use the ability to re-order the watch display, included images on the main page (so that you can find the watch you&amp;rsquo;re looking for visually) and made it easier to jump between the various watch box views (i.</description>

      <description>Air Fryr - An Air Fryer Companion app Link to heading With energy bills going through the roof, the world seems to have gone air fryer mad over the last year or so.&#xA;I had an old one that was only ever used for making chips (aka French fries for any readers on the other side of the Atlantic!), but I recently had a bunch of cashback pending from Quidco (if you&amp;rsquo;re in the UK and don&amp;rsquo;t already use Quidco you should give them a look), so decided to treat myself to an absolute beast of an Air Fryer.</description>

      <description>Users and Earnings Link to heading So, back in September I both implemented ads on the site and released my first proper app (although I didn&amp;rsquo;t put Ads into WristCheck until v1.2 about a month later).&#xA;This was all a fun experiment to see if I could make this wee hobby break even&amp;hellip; want to hear how it&amp;rsquo;s going?&#xA;A summary of costs Link to heading Let&amp;rsquo;s start off with what it costs to put things together.</description>

      <description>WristCheck 101: Getting started with WristCheck Link to heading WristCheck has been out in the wild for a little over a month now, and as I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before I&amp;rsquo;ve got plans to continually add more functionality to the app and keep it supported for a good while (free time permitting of course!)&#xA;Now I&amp;rsquo;d not claim to be the worlds best developer, nor am I a professional UX designer - I&amp;rsquo;ve just built an app to the best of my abilities that performs some functions that I want access to (and on the way added some things based on user feedback) - so the app has a few bugs and might not be as straight-forward to navigate as I think it is&amp;hellip;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a site I&amp;rsquo;ve built far more for myself than for anyone else, but hey, if you&amp;rsquo;ve found you&amp;rsquo;re way here thanks for visiting (and if you&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed your time here, even better!</description>

      <description>MTB Lockdown upgrades part 1: The Wolf Tooth Bling Kit Link to heading Like many parts of the world, the global Covid-19 pandemic has lead to a period of lockdown in Scotland, which has resulted in me transitioning to working from home, whilst also home-schooling my kids and unable to get out properly on my mountain bike (I say &amp;lsquo;properly&amp;rsquo; as I have no decent trails near me - I am however getting out whenever I can just to spin the wheels with my boys, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been entirely unable to send it).</description>
