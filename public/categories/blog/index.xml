      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re over halfway through 2024, and as I type this I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated the site at all this year&amp;hellip; which is madness, as I&amp;rsquo;ve got lots to share!&#xA;I may go back and backdate some posts, with some updates on the apps and a long overdue earning update, but first&amp;hellip;&#xA;Rebuilding the site Link to heading I recently got a new Macbook, which has absolutely supercharged my development - seriously, the jump from an underpowered Intel based machine to the latest Apple Silicon is like stepping into the future!</description>

      <description>In early June I got a rather unexpected email from Apple&amp;rsquo;s legal team&amp;hellip;&#xA;My little watch app WristCheck had come to the attention of a much bigger WristCheck - the folks at wristcheck.com, who had reached out, via Apple, to let me know that they held a Trademark on the name&amp;hellip;&#xA;Now, before I go any further I want to be really clear that I don&amp;rsquo;t grudge the WristCheck team for wanting to protect their Trademark - they absolutely have a right to do that and I should have had the sense to check when I created the app!</description>

      <description>Breaking Even&amp;hellip; Link to heading Right, while I&amp;rsquo;m in the blogging mood, here&amp;rsquo;s another post that really is long overdue! Back in March (wow!) I wrote a quick update on how much income I&amp;rsquo;d made via advertising on WristCheck and via ads on the website and promised further updates.&#xA;Since then a few major things have happened - firstly, I released two additional apps (technically I released MP Checklist just before that post&amp;hellip;) and secondly I finally got around to adding an in-app payment option to allow users to pay what they wanted to turn the ads off forever (and again, I definitely need to write a little about how and why I implemented that!</description>

      <description>Users and Earnings Link to heading So, back in September I both implemented ads on the site and released my first proper app (although I didn&amp;rsquo;t put Ads into WristCheck until v1.2 about a month later).&#xA;This was all a fun experiment to see if I could make this wee hobby break even&amp;hellip; want to hear how it&amp;rsquo;s going?&#xA;A summary of costs Link to heading Let&amp;rsquo;s start off with what it costs to put things together.</description>

      <description>Adding Ads&amp;hellip; and stuff&amp;hellip; Link to heading Yep, I&amp;rsquo;ve done it&amp;hellip;sorry.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve gone ahead and added some hideous advertising all across the site&amp;hellip;but why?&#xA;Good question, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I have a good answer&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s not really to make money, as the volume of readers of this site are tiny. It&amp;rsquo;s a site I&amp;rsquo;ve built far more for myself than for anyone else, but hey, if you&amp;rsquo;ve found you&amp;rsquo;re way here thanks for visiting (and if you&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed your time here, even better!</description>
