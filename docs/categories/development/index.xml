      <description>My blog workflow So, I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post as much for my own benefit as anyone else&amp;rsquo;s. The last time I tried to build a blog I left it alone for a while and when I came back to it I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten the steps to build it&amp;hellip; If this is of benefit to anyone else though, great!
I&amp;rsquo;ve put this blog together using Hugo, a static site generator. What does that mean?</description>
