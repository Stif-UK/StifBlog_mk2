          Attempting to grow my user base # Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve released three apps - two of which I&amp;rsquo;d like to think have the potential to be really useful to a decent number of people (sorry MP Checklist&amp;hellip; I think you might just be a bit too niche!) - I think it&amp;rsquo;s time that I make a bit more of an effort to get help more people to find the apps!

          Air Fryr - An Air Fryer Companion app # With energy bills going through the roof, the world seems to have gone air fryer mad over the last year or so.
I had an old one that was only ever used for making chips (aka French fries for any readers on the other side of the Atlantic!), but I recently had a bunch of cashback pending from Quidco (if you&amp;rsquo;re in the UK and don&amp;rsquo;t already use Quidco you should give them a look), so decided to treat myself to an absolute beast of an Air Fryer.
