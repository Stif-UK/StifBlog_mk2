  WristCheck v1.3 Release Notes

</h2>
<hr>
<p>Version 1.3 of WristCheck is now available to the app beta testers, so will be released over the next couple of days (as I write this I&rsquo;ve already got confirmation that Apple have approved it, so it&rsquo;s just a case of hitting the button!) As <a href="/posts/wristcheck_v1.2/">before</a> I thought I&rsquo;d share a post with a bit more information on what&rsquo;s changed, expanding a bit on the bullet points you&rsquo;ll see in the app or on the store listings.</p>
<h3 id="updates-to-image-handling">
  Updates to Image Handling
  <a href="#updates-to-image-handling" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h3>
<p>This is probably the biggest change in v1.3 and perhaps worth discussing a bit here. Firstly, to summarise how the app handles images, when a user wants to add a watch image to a watch record, they click a wee &lsquo;add image&rsquo; button, which pulls up a <em>bottom sheet</em> allowing them to select whether to select the image from their gallery, or to take a new one with their camera - this is achieved using the Flutter <em>image_picker</em> library.</p>
<p>Once selected or taken, the image file is then passed to a second library, <em>image_cropper</em> to, you guessed it, crop it - by doing this I can control the aspect ratio of the final image, which allows me to better manage the page layout.</p>
<p>Finally, the image is saved - there are two parts to this. First, the image file is saved locally on the phone and secondly the <em>path</em> to this image file is saved as a parameter of the watch record in the database (I purposely keep the images and watch records separate - a small database means a faster, more responsive app even for large collections, thus the images themselves are <em>not</em> in the database).</p>
<p>As you can imaging, to achieve all of the above I&rsquo;ve got a series of methods written, including <em>pickImage()</em>, <em>saveImage()</em>, <em>imageSourcePopUp()</em> etc.</p>
<p>Initially some of these were methods within the class for the page, and others were in my <em>WatchMethods()</em> class, but given these all relate to the same purpose - managing images - I began v1.3 by refactoring all image related code out into its own <em>ImageUtil()</em> utility class.</p>
<p>This keeps everything together in its own wee corner of the app, simplifying code maintenance and supporting reusability.</p>
<p>As part of this refactor I also fixed some hidden issues with the earlier versions of the app.
Firstly, the app now creates an <em>/img/</em> subdirectory in the apps storage - on Android you&rsquo;ll never see this as app data is hidden and encrypted, but on iOS you can use <em>Files</em> to navigate the app directory and see the structure. Therefore from v1.3 all images will live in this sub-folder (which will make building a backup solution for images in future easier too!)</p>
<p>I also updating the way images are named - previousy the image_cropper plugin threw out a random name, which is fine if you never see the file, but will be rubbish if you export them to use later - so now the images get a more human readable name!</p>
<p>Secondly, in the early versions of the app images would be saved along with their paths (as above)&hellip;but they were never deleted! <em>(oops!)</em>
Therefore if you deleted a watch or changed it&rsquo;s picture, the old one was still sitting there taking up space on your phone&hellip;
Clearly, that is <em>Not Very Good!</em></p>
<p>Thus in v1.3 I&rsquo;ve fixed this! Now whenever a new image is saved, the old one is deleted (if it exists), as well as images being deleted when a watch is deleted, or if the &lsquo;delete collection&rsquo; button is triggered, they&rsquo;re all deleted (I doubt anyone will use that &lsquo;delete all&rsquo; function, but it was useful for testing so I kept it in&hellip;)</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t just do this refactoring to fix <em>glaring issues</em>, it was also done to support two new features&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="add-watch-images-when-adding-a-new-watch">
  Add watch images when adding a new watch
  <a href="#add-watch-images-when-adding-a-new-watch" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h3>
<p>I was asked more than once why, when adding a new watch record, the user had to add the watch and then go in and edit it to add an image to it. Partly this was down to how I&rsquo;d implemented the code to save the image. Partly it was down to needing a watch record to exist, before it could save the image path to it (see my note above about keeping the images out of the database).</p>
<p>But following this refactoring, I&rsquo;ve now made it easy for me to manage this - the UI isn&rsquo;t fantastic to be honest <em>(is any of my UI?)</em> but it works, and users can now add watch pictures at the same time as they record their new watch in the app!</p>
<h3 id="add-caseback-images">
  Add caseback images!
  <a href="#add-caseback-images" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h3>
<p>One of the most requested additions to the app was the ability to add a second image for each watch, to show the caseback - and with the above work complete, this became a nice easy task! Now you can save both a main image and a second one (and hey, nobody is forcing you to take a picture of the caseback, you can use it for the bracelet clasp or whatever you want!)</p>
<p><img src="/img/2022-10/CaseBackImg.png" alt="WristCheck CaseBack Image">
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><em>Some casebacks are worth sharing!</em><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="_minor-improvements_">
  <em>&ldquo;Minor Improvements&rdquo;</em>
  <a href="#_minor-improvements_" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Every app release always includes a few <em>little things</em> that don&rsquo;t make the headlines, but again it&rsquo;s good to give an idea of what&rsquo;s going on!</p>
<p>Firstly, another change that&rsquo;s come from user feedback, is that watch names now auto-capitalise the first letter of each word - a small change, but one that was asked for a few times!</p>
<p><em>(as an aside, comments on this blog seem to have broken&hellip;sure that&rsquo;s my fault&hellip; you can provide feedback via the app stores themselves as a user review, or via email - again on the store listings - or finally there&rsquo;s a thread on the <a href="https://www.christopherwardforum.com/offtopic/wristcheck-stif-s-mobile-watchbox-app-project-almost-at-beta-t59567.html">Christopher Ward Forum</a> )</em></p>
<p>Another change that falls under the &lsquo;minor improvements&rsquo; category is updating the help text relating to the watch calendar view - if you click to see the dates you&rsquo;ve worn a watch when no dates are tracked the on screen text was misleading, and there was no additional guidance on this page - which is rubbish since this is where you can add to or amend the watches history! (I think I&rsquo;ll also write a <a href="/categories/wristcheck-guides-faqs/">guide</a> about this at some point too&hellip;)</p>
<h3 id="app-review-prompt">
  App Review Prompt
  <a href="#app-review-prompt" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Lastly, to round out these release notes the last change was to implement a review prompt in the app. Both Android and iOS provide libraries to do this, which are now also both encapsulated in a Flutter library, so the core implementation is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Both app stores also ensure that this isn&rsquo;t abused, and thus any request to show a prompt is first checked with the underlying platform before it&rsquo;s shown (thus nobody should ever get one at <em>every login</em>)</p>
<p>I laid some groundwork for this in an earlier release <em>(v1.1 I think)</em> by recording in the background how many times the app was opened and how many times watches had been marked as worn. These stats live locally on the device and weren&rsquo;t used, but it&rsquo;s allowed me to write some logic to make sure the prompt is triggered only after a user has had a chance to make some use of the app.
If dismissed it will then potentially re-prompt after around 100 days - a good space to hopefully help gather further feedback as I continue to improve the app.</p>
<p>I <em>haven&rsquo;t</em> hidden this prompt behind a <em>&lsquo;do you like this app&rsquo;</em> question first (lots of apps do this, to make sure that only users who are going to rate an app highly get the actual prompt)&hellip; partly this is through laziness, it would be more work to do, but at this point I&rsquo;m not desperate for everyone to rate WristCheck 4 or 5 stars (although it would be nice!), but rather I want to get as much feedback as possible to help me continue to make the app better!</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s it for v1.3&hellip; v1.4 will be along soon enough in another 3-4 weeks!</p>
