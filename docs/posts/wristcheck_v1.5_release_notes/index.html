  WristCheck v1.5 Release Notes
  <a href="#wristcheck-v15-release-notes" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h2>
<hr>
<p>Opps - I seem to have skipped writing up notes when I released WristCheck v1.4! <em>(and for the last couple of Air Fryr releases&hellip;)</em>  I&rsquo;ll add a quick summary at the end!</p>
<p>But onto the details - WristCheck 1.5 is a fairly big update to the user interface of the main watchbox view. I&rsquo;ve made search more prominent, given a use the ability to re-order the watch display, included images on the main page (so that you can find the watch you&rsquo;re looking for visually) and made it easier to jump between the various watch box views (i.e. the wish list and sold watches lists).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go through these to summarise the main changes&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="redesign-of-the-watch-box-ui">
  Redesign of the Watch Box UI
  <a href="#redesign-of-the-watch-box-ui" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The original view presented in WristCheck was just a sterile text only list of watches, with an expanding accordion tile at the top that hid links to search and the secondary watch box views&hellip; I was never particularly happy with this view. When I was getting stuck into using Flutter I had issues with getting images onto the tiles without them messing up the various dimensions, and I just <em>could not</em> get the view to refresh as I wanted when the database filters were changed, hence creating separate individual pages for the sold watches and wishlist views.</p>
<p>But a year or so into my adventures with Flutter I&rsquo;m now much more confident with it&rsquo;s capabilities and how the various widgets interact with each other&hellip; so it felt like a good time to rebuild the homepage!</p>
<p><img src="/img/2023-09/dark_listview.jpg" alt="WristCheck new UI">
<sub><em>The new user interface!</em></sub></p>
<p>One major update is the addition of the drop-down picker at the top of the page - you can now move from your watch box, to wish list, to list of sold watches or directly to a random watch by selecting from the dropdown and the page will instantly refresh to display your selection! No more navigating to <em>different pages!</em></p>
<h3 id="search-is-more-prominent">
  Search is more prominent
  <a href="#search-is-more-prominent" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h3>
<p>From a quick look at the image above you&rsquo;ll see that the ability to search your collection is no longer hidden away - it&rsquo;s always right there in the top right of the home screen.</p>
<p>From the start I wanted WristCheck to work well for users with large watch collections - a common complaint I heard about other apps was that they started to slow down or got to a point where it was just too hard to find the watch you wanted once you&rsquo;d added so many, so a quick and easy real-time search option was a must - I&rsquo;m super happy that this is now easy to find and right in front of the user!</p>
<h3 id="quickly-re-order-your-collection">
  Quickly re-order your collection
  <a href="#quickly-re-order-your-collection" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Previously the watches always appeared in the list in the order you added them to the database&hellip; which was <em>fine</em>, but not the best experience&hellip; whenever you got a new watch, it would always be the last one on the screen!</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve added the ability to re-order the collection on the fly, using one of several options (I restrained myself to avoid overdoing it, but if something is really missing shout out in an app review!)</p>
<p><img src="/img/2023-09/display_order.jpg" alt="Display Order Picker">
<sub><em>Quickly re-order your collection!</em></sub></p>
<p>Since moving the release from my test device to my day to day phone I&rsquo;ve found this fantastic! I like to show my collection by last worn date, so my recently worn watches are always at the top (and when I wear something different from the previous day it&rsquo;s nice to see the page refresh itself!)</p>
<h3 id="watch-images-in-the-main-view">
  Watch images in the main view
  <a href="#watch-images-in-the-main-view" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Another long overdue, and often asked for feature! The watch list now shows a small thumbnail of the watches! Again this turns out to be really useful for quickly finding the watch you&rsquo;ve just put on when you go in to track what you&rsquo;re wearing, and has been something I&rsquo;ve been meaning to figure out for <em>ages&hellip;</em></p>
<p>&hellip;but that&rsquo;s not all!</p>
<h3 id="grid-or-list-view">
  Grid or list view
  <a href="#grid-or-list-view" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h3>
<p>I mentioned at the start of this post that the original watch view was just a fairly sterile list of watches&hellip; and I&rsquo;ve just mentioned that that sterile list now includes an image of the watch&hellip; but what if you want <em>more</em>?</p>
<p>Well, now you also have the option to change the default view to a grid view, with larger pictures!</p>
<p><img src="/img/2023-09/light_gridview.jpg" alt="WristCheck Grid View">
<sub><em>Display your collection in a grid view!</em></sub></p>
<p>I should call out that this viewing pattern doesn&rsquo;t work well on very small screens - if your screen is too small then the watch names (neatly) truncate, and the wear dates may be hidden behind the box border! But it works well on most modern phones!</p>
<p>Personally I love this view - I&rsquo;ve found myself using it day to day over the original list view!</p>
<h3 id="_minor-improvements_">
  <em>&ldquo;Minor Improvements&rdquo;</em>
  <a href="#_minor-improvements_" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The last piece of the puzzle for v1.5 is hidden away! Google now request that developers target the latest version of Android, so had requested I ensured my SDK target was updated to level 33&hellip;which I&rsquo;m sure sounds rather boring, but as part of this I also updated the underlying Flutter version I was using and updated <em>some</em> of the libraries the app makes use of to function - all hidden away under the hood, but hopefully it&rsquo;ll make for a smoother app experience!</p>
<h3 id="what-about-version-14">
  What about version 1.4?
  <a href="#what-about-version-14" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h3>
<p>I mentioned at the start that I&rsquo;d forgotten to provide an update when I release WristCheck v1.4, so figure I&rsquo;ll add a quick update here to close out the post.</p>
<p>Version 1.4 was probably the most important release of the app since I launched it, as it included integrating the RevenueCat SDK to allow me to set up some simple in-app purchases within the app - this really deserves it&rsquo;s own separate post (as I also integrated this into Air Fryr). I&rsquo;ll write up a full post about monetisation (as a follow up to my previous advertising revenue one), but from a WristCheck point of view, the key change in v1.4 was the ability for a user to choose their own price for the app to become ad-free.</p>
