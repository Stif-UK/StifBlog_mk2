              Breaking Even&hellip; # Right, while I&rsquo;m in the blogging mood, here&rsquo;s another post that really is long overdue! Back in March (wow!) I wrote a quick update on how much income I&rsquo;d made via advertising on WristCheck and via ads on the website and promised further updates.
Since then a few major things have happened - firstly, I released two additional apps (technically I released MP Checklist just before that post&hellip;) and secondly I finally got around to adding an in-app payment option to allow users to pay what they wanted to turn the ads off forever (and again, I definitely need to write a little about how and why I implemented that!

But onto the details - WristCheck 1.5 is a fairly big update to the user interface of the main watchbox view. I&rsquo;ve made search more prominent, given a use the ability to re-order the watch display, included images on the main page (so that you can find the watch you&rsquo;re looking for visually) and made it easier to jump between the various watch box views (i.

I had an old one that was only ever used for making chips (aka French fries for any readers on the other side of the Atlantic!), but I recently had a bunch of cashback pending from Quidco (if you&rsquo;re in the UK and don&rsquo;t already use Quidco you should give them a look), so decided to treat myself to an absolute beast of an Air Fryer.

              WristCheck v1.3 Release Notes # Version 1.3 of WristCheck is now available to the app beta testers, so will be released over the next couple of days (as I write this I&rsquo;ve already got confirmation that Apple have approved it, so it&rsquo;s just a case of hitting the button!) As before I thought I&rsquo;d share a post with a bit more information on what&rsquo;s changed, expanding a bit on the bullet points you&rsquo;ll see in the app or on the store listings.

              WristCheck 101: Getting started with WristCheck # WristCheck has been out in the wild for a little over a month now, and as I&rsquo;ve mentioned before I&rsquo;ve got plans to continually add more functionality to the app and keep it supported for a good while (free time permitting of course!)
Now I&rsquo;d not claim to be the worlds best developer, nor am I a professional UX designer - I&rsquo;ve just built an app to the best of my abilities that performs some functions that I want access to (and on the way added some things based on user feedback) - so the app has a few bugs and might not be as straight-forward to navigate as I think it is&hellip;

Ads! # Yep, I originally said these would be in v1.1, but I wanted to make sure backup/restore and notifications could be properly tested, so I pushed out v1.

I love the above quote, and when I hit release on WristCheck v1.0 I was acutely aware that this app was not finished!
I&rsquo;ve got a whole bunch of additional features I&rsquo;m planning to add, but initially I&rsquo;ve set my sights on a small number that will make up v1.

              How long does an electric car take to charge? # After &ldquo;How far does it go?&rdquo;, the next most common question I&rsquo;ve heard since buying an electric car is &ldquo;How long does it take to charge?&rdquo;.
I think a lot of people find the answer surprising, I certainly did when I started investigating purchasing a hybrid and quickly found myself drawn towards the mysterious world of EV ownership.
The answer though is &ldquo;it depends&hellip;&rdquo;, quickly followed by &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s not really the right question anyway&hellip;&rdquo;

              Sentinels of the Multiverse Review # (This review was originally posted on Boardgaming.com and subsequently posted on the old version of this blog, hence the 2015 post date!)
Sentinels, ASSEMBLE # Baron Blade and his minions are attempting to destroy Megalopolis using their mobile attack platform! It’s time to join forces with Legacy and the other heroes of the Multiverse to take him down!
Sentinels of the Multiverse is a co-operative card game for 2-5 players, which can be played in 30-45 minutes (although you might just find you want to start another game straight after…)

              BattleStar Galactica: The Board Game - Review # (This review was originally posted on Boardgaming.com and subsequently posted on the old version of this blog)
Humanity has lost # The second Cylon war is over. Humanity has lost, and now it’s only hope for survival is a small fleet of ships carrying all that remains of the human population, lead by the aging Battlestar Galactica.
Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is based on the first season of the 2004 re-imagining of the classic 70’s TV show, where the surviving human fleet desperately tries to escape their Cylon pursuers on their way to the planet Kobol – the legendary planet where humanity began (and a waypoint on their longer journey to find the fabled 13th colony, Earth).
