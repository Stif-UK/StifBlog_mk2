  How long does an electric car take to charge?

<hr>
<p>After <em>&ldquo;How far does it go?&rdquo;</em>, the next most common question I&rsquo;ve heard since buying an electric car is <em>&ldquo;How long does it take to charge?&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people find the answer surprising, I certainly did when I started investigating purchasing a hybrid and quickly found myself drawn towards the mysterious world of EV ownership.</p>
<p>The answer though is <em>&ldquo;it depends&hellip;&rdquo;</em>, quickly followed by <em>&ldquo;and that&rsquo;s not really the right question anyway&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="_it-depends_">
  <em>It depends&hellip;</em>
  <a href="#_it-depends_" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h3>
<p>So, the reason <em>it depends</em> is that there are different charging speeds available to an EV (additionally, different cars have different battery capacities, but lets skip that for now&hellip;)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trickle charging</strong> - Using a <em>granny cable</em> to plug into a standard home plug socket <em>(here in the UK, that&rsquo;s 240V at 10A - approximately a 3kW/h charge rate)</em></li>
<li><strong>Fast charging</strong> - This uses a proprietary plug socket to charge at a faster rate: At home I have a <em>240V, 32A</em> connection available, which equates to roughly a <em>7kW/h charge rate</em> <em>(however some cars can use public fast chargers that go triple this rate)</em></li>
<li><strong>Rapid charging</strong> - The chargers you&rsquo;ll usually find at motorway services, these have speeds <em>starting</em> at 50kW/h (although as batteries approach full things slow down so as not to damage the battery). Half an hour on one of these suckers and I&rsquo;m <em>pretty much</em> full.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s the three types of charging, and you might have noticed that <em>(aside from a hint at the end&hellip;)</em> I didn&rsquo;t actually answer the question at all, instead focusing on <em>speed</em> rather than <em>time.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="_thats-not-really-the-right-question-anyway_">
  <em>That&rsquo;s not really the right question anyway</em>
  <a href="#_thats-not-really-the-right-question-anyway_" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s return to my other point - asking how long a car takes to charge isn&rsquo;t really valid - rather <em>the rate you gain range is</em>. In other words the more useful value is how much range you can add to the car in a given period.</p>
<p>The reason for this is simple - when you drive an EV, your home is your refueling station 99% of the time, so you can wake up every morning with a <em>&lsquo;full tank&rsquo;</em>. I expect for the majority of users the range you get from a full tank is more than adequate for their average day, so the only time the recharge time is a consideration is when you&rsquo;re going to go beyond that range.</p>
<p>Hence the <em>correct</em> question - if you know you&rsquo;re going to exceed your range, how long do you need to plug the car in for to make <em>the rest of your journey.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>So how about I <em>finally</em> answer the question&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>My car is a previous generation 2017 Nissan Leaf, with the 30kWh battery pack - this gives me an effective range of around 100 miles on a full battery <em>which means I&rsquo;m comfortable going about 80 between charges</em>. I also paid a little extra to upgrade the onboard charger to 6.6kWh <em>(ignore the confusing numbers - all this means is that the rate of charge I can get from a Type 2, or &lsquo;Fast&rsquo;, charger is twice the standard rate for the Leaf)</em>.
With the general efficiency of my car I know that on the 3 types of charger mentioned above I can add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trickle charge - <em>+10 miles of range per hour plugged in</em></li>
<li>Fast charge - <em>+25 miles of range per hour plugged in</em></li>
<li>Rapid charge - <em>+100 miles of range per hour plugged in</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So, to put this in perspective, 99% of my journeys see me going less than 50 miles from home. On journeys on the boundary of that, if I can plug my car into a public Fast charger for just an hour, I&rsquo;m comfortable. Likewise if I&rsquo;m just having a day with <em>a lot</em> of local driving, just plugging in for an hour at home, or whilst shopping, is usually more than enough to give me the extra <em>juice</em> I need.</p>
<p>On long journeys I&rsquo;ll take a bit of time to plan ahead, planning routes that stop at Rapid chargers (with back-ups in the plan incase the primary one isn&rsquo;t available) such that I&rsquo;m stopping at a charger around the time I&rsquo;d want to be eating anyway - you&rsquo;d be surprised how quickly half an hour can vanish! <em>(I&rsquo;ve been in the situation where I&rsquo;ve plugged the car in, and by the time I&rsquo;ve walked to a coffee shop and been served my car is close to full)</em>.</p>
<p>Doing this I&rsquo;ve taken my car from Glasgow to Manchester <em>(about 220 miles)</em> without much fuss.</p>
<hr>
<p>I suppose I wanted to write this post as this knowledge really opened my eyes when I was researching purchasing my car and is what ultimately convinced me that a full EV was for me, rather than a hybrid.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing is that over the past year or two EV&rsquo;s have become even more capable, with larger batteries and faster rapid charging available (the basic new Nissan Leaf has 30% more range than mine for example, and one with twice the range is now available).</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve stumbled across this post then I hope you&rsquo;ve found it useful!</p>
