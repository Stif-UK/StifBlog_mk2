      <description>7 Things to do while your electric car charges So after writing a bit about how long an electric car takes to charge, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a short post about things to do to whilst your car charges - believe it or not this is something I Googled while I was first investigating EV ownership!
1. Write a blog post There&amp;rsquo;s something quite therapeutic about writing, even when you&amp;rsquo;re not very good at it&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>How long does an electric car take to charge? After &amp;ldquo;How far does it go?&amp;rdquo;, the next most common question I&amp;rsquo;ve heard since buying an electric car is &amp;ldquo;How long does it take to charge?&amp;rdquo;.
I think a lot of people find the answer surprising, I certainly did when I started investigating purchasing a hybrid and quickly found myself drawn towards the mysterious world of EV ownership.
The answer though is &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, quickly followed by &amp;ldquo;and that&amp;rsquo;s not really the right question anyway&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>My blog workflow So, I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post as much for my own benefit as anyone else&amp;rsquo;s. The last time I tried to build a blog I left it alone for a while and when I came back to it I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten the steps to build it&amp;hellip; If this is of benefit to anyone else though, great!
I&amp;rsquo;ve put this blog together using Hugo, a static site generator. What does that mean?</description>

      <description>Putting the Cart before the Horse So, this isn&amp;rsquo;t the first website I&amp;rsquo;ve ever thrown together. Nor the first blog. Not even the first blog built using a static site generator&amp;hellip;
A few years ago (I&amp;rsquo;d love to say a couple, but I&amp;rsquo;m scared it&amp;rsquo;s now far more&amp;hellip;), I registered the domain granthutchison.com, not only because vanity domains are cool, but because I wanted to carve out a little corner of the internet to write and play.</description>
