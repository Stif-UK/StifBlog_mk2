<hr>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve released three apps - two of which I&rsquo;d like to think have the potential to be really useful to a decent number of people (sorry MP Checklist&hellip; I think you might just be a bit <em>too niche!)</em> - I think it&rsquo;s time that I make a bit more of an effort to get help more people to <em>find</em> the apps!</p>
<p>So, as well as releasing updates to both <a href="/posts/wristcheck_v1.5_release_notes/">WristCheck</a> and Air Fryr recently, I&rsquo;ve also undertaken a couple of tasks with the hope of getting the apps in front of more people.</p>
<h3 id="the-landing-pages">
  The landing pages
  <a href="#the-landing-pages" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h3>
<p>First, now that my apps have <em>broken even</em> (another long overdue post! Since monetising the apps I&rsquo;ve earned enough to cover my annual development fees, but I&rsquo;m a <em>long way</em> from what I&rsquo;d call &lsquo;profitable&rsquo;!) I thought I&rsquo;d spend a little and register some domains for the apps.</p>
<p>Starting with <a href="https://www.getairfryr.com">getAirFryr.com</a> and then following the same pattern with <a href="https://www.wristcheck.app">wristcheck.app</a>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve clicked on the links above you&rsquo;ll see that not only have I registered the domains, but I&rsquo;ve put up landing pages for each app too! I found a super simple Jekyll template created by <a href="https://emilbaehr.com/">Emil Baehr</a> which let me create simple homepages for the apps really easily - it was as simple as forking his repository on github, changing some config and page content and then publishing via github pages (which also means they&rsquo;re currently free to host!).</p>
<p>Having a simple landing page for each app, where I can provide direct links to each app store, highlight the key app features and publish a quick and simple changelog for each (and link back to this blog where I can continue to write a bit more in-depth, diary style about the apps) is great, as it means I just need to provide a simple web link if I want to share the apps with anyone, rather than trying to direct them to find the app themselves on the appropriate app store.</p>
<h3 id="am-i-an-influencer-yet">
  Am I an influencer yet?
  <a href="#am-i-an-influencer-yet" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The next step in my <em>master plan</em> (lol!) was to create a social media presence for the apps - I&rsquo;m approaching this from a couple of directions.</p>
<p>To start with, I set up an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/getairfryr/">Instagram account</a> for Air Fryr - as I built the app to help me get the most from my air fryer, it probably comes as no surprise that I use it to cook a lot, so I thought I could capture and share lots of pictures and short, poorly filmed videos (I&rsquo;ve only posted a couple so far, which have had about 150 views each) - for Air Fryr I think I&rsquo;ll also branch out to TikTok as it seems fitting.</p>
<p>For WristCheck I&rsquo;ve done something similar, but with more of a focus on just sharing pictures - I often post watch shots to some Facebook groups already, so all I&rsquo;m really doing here is the same but now I&rsquo;ve got a wee dedicated <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wristcheck.app/">Instagram corner</a> to do it in!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also set up a profile for WristCheck on the social media platform formerly known as <a href="https://twitter.com/WristcheckApp">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>My intention is just to share watch and air fryer related pictures, comments, reels etc in the hope of getting the apps a bit more visible (with minimal effort and expense)&hellip; will it work? Who knows! But it&rsquo;ll be fun anyway!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll post an update at some point in the future if I ever manage to get more than three followers&hellip;</p>
