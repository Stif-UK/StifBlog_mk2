<p>Hi, my name is <strong>Grant</strong> and I created this place so that I had somewhere to dump my thoughts and share my projects on the internet.</p>
<p>By day I&rsquo;m a <em>Scrum Master</em> at a large UK bank, helping to transform our business and digital delivery to be more <em>Agile.</em></p>
<p>I love the work that I do and the people that I do it with - as with many who work with Agile methodologies I&rsquo;m passionate about working <em>smarter</em> to deliver better outcomes faster for our users and stakeholders.</p>
<p>In 2020 I also completed my bachelors degree in <em>Software Engineering</em> with
<a href="https://www.open.ac.uk" title="The Open University">the Open University</a>.
I love tinkering and playing with code - once upon a time I had hoped to become a mobile app developer, however it turned out my skills were best utilised helping development teams work better and protect them from all the outside noise of a large organisation. So instead I like to mess around with this stuff in my free time.</p>
<p>This site gives me a chance to showcase some of these projects as well as gives a home to allow me to host some of those necessary bits of paperwork such as privacy policies etc <em>(app development would be much more fun without all the paperwork!)</em></p>
